The whole thing is absurd, and part of me can’t help but think it is purposefully so, Black playing with a number of hard-boiled genre conventions much in the same way he did with the astonishingly underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. It even follows something of a similar game plan what with two mismatched sleuths stumbling into a partnership as they assemble a crazy, disjointed puzzle the pieces of which don’t look like they’ll ever fit together until they miraculously do. Here, he also throws in 13-year-old Holly (reminiscent of The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight, Black never one to shy away from putting kids in perilous situations), the youngster arguably the smartest player on the court, figuring out the ins and outs of the mess they’re all stranded within long before any of the adults do. But, make no mistake, this is the Crowe and Gosling show right from the start. Both actors not only show sparkling comedic rapport, they also go out of their respective ways to give each of their relatively one-dimensional antiheroes having layers and complexities that the script only hints at. The latter shows zero fear as far as looking like a fool is concerned, while the former brings a battle-scarred emotional weariness to things that’s a little surprising. More than that, though, the two have an almost Abbott and Costello-like air to their interactions that’s hysterical. Even the nastier portions of the film have a comedic bent that’s made infectious almost entirely thanks to them, Crowe and Gosling proving to be as inspired a pairing of major male stars as any in recent memory. It all does feel more than a little too thin at times, almost as if Black and Bagarozzi were one more rewrite away from crafting something truly special. The majority of the villains feel like thinly crafted afterthoughts, while Matt Bomer’s primary thug is nowhere near as menacing as I kept hoping he would be. As for the identity of those pulling the strings, figuring that out is easy (and, admittedly, not exactly the point), so there’s little shock and even less awe as Healy and March realize little, if anything, is going to work out as they both hoped it would. I like the ruthlessness of it all, however, Black not even slightly afraid to push the envelope almost as far as he can. There’s also a strong case to be made that he and Bagarozzi have crafted a love story of sorts here, the playful, almost romantic give and take between the two heroes ultimately kind of sweet, Healy and March appearing to plant the seeds of a relationship that could at some point progress far beyond platonic. Featuring crackerjack action sequences and bursting with an infectious sense of humor that’s laugh-out-loud hilarious, The Nice Guys is a major blast, Crowe and Gosling having the time of their lives bringing all this madcap, blood-splattered lunacy to life.

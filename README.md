# Simple-Neural-Networks

In this repository you'll find 2 simple applications of neural networks for Python 3.8.

To run them run clothes_predictor.py or movie_reviews.py.

I used tensorflow to create the layers between neurones and keras to get the databases from which the data comes from.

"clothes-predictor.py" gets a database containing images of different kind of clothes. After training the model, it accurately can predict which clothes it's seeing based on a 2D model of the intial image.

"movie-reviews.py" takes an initial document "test.txt", reads it and using a database of words it can predict if some text it's positive or negative.
In this case I applied it to determine if a movie review it's good or bad.
